# ontology-references
Guides and references to ontology concepts and resources.

This repository contains documents summarizing useful concepts or resources to work with formal ontologies. In some cases, I collected the documents from the internet and credit for them should go to their authors. I create this repository only as a service to whoever is interested in ontology (including myself).
